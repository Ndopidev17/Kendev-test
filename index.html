This built a spirit of curiosity in me and I begun to watch tutorials from the internet.</p>
                        <p>I begun as an absolute beginner with learning the HTML and CSS basics. I also went to pickup some knowledge on Javascript but unfortunately it seemed quite more logical, This never made me to giveup.

                        <p>In addition, web development does not stop on the <em>frontend</em> part only,It also has the <b>Backend</b> part that does the logical and dynamic functionality fo th Website. <b>Backend</b> involves usage of server-side programming languages suchas <b>PHP</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>PYTHON</b>, <b>JAVA</b> and many others.</p>
                        <q>Put it in mind that <b>JAVA</b> isn't the same as <b>Javascript</b> they're absolutely different.</q>
